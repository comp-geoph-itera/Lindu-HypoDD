a directory for the mingw64 source files. it should contain these following folders:
	
	1. bin\
	2. lib\
	3. libexec\
	4. x86_64-w64-mingw32\
	
In order to fill `mingw64` folder, we can copy the contents from the release compressed (Lindu_hypoDD_vX.X.X.zip) files. The contents has been reduced from the source files (in the original website). Therefore, we should use the release instead of download `mingw64`.
